If you're passing both pageNo and pageSize while calling the API, the logic remains the same, but the API will return only a specific number of records based on the pageSize. Here's how you can structure the process to keep calling the API until all records are fetched:

Steps:

1. Set the initial values for pageNo and pageSize.


2. Call the API using the current pageNo and pageSize.


3. Process the records from the response.


4. Increment pageNo and repeat the call until you've fetched all records.



Example in Python:

pageNo = 1  # Start with the first page
pageSize = 100  # Number of records per page (customize based on your requirement)
total_pages = 1  # Initialize total pages

while pageNo <= total_pages:
    # Make the API call with the current page number and page size
    response = api_call(pageNo=pageNo, pageSize=pageSize)
    
    # Process the records from the response
    records = response["records"]
    total_pages = response["totalNoOfPages"]  # Get the total number of pages from the response
    
    # Do something with the records, like storing or processing them
    process_records(records)
    
    # Increment the page number to fetch the next set of records
    pageNo += 1

Key Points:

1. Initial API Call: Start by setting pageNo = 1 and an appropriate pageSize.


2. Process the Response: Extract the records and the total number of pages (totalNoOfPages) from the response.


3. Continue Fetching: Continue fetching records by incrementing pageNo until all pages have been fetched.


4. Custom Page Size: Adjust pageSize as needed for performance or API limits.



This pattern will work with any paginated API where the total number of pages is known upfront and you fetch a specific number of records per page.
